%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Configuration Settings%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
If running the line using the start command these are the fixed operating parameters
If Running the Line in experiment mode then these represent the conditions of the first run 
If Running an experiment further parameters such as start and end values, as well as step sizes need to be set in the experiments section at the bottom of this file. 

% Control Type
Control_Method Local_Control
Run_Downstream_Units 1

% Line Configuration 
Feed = 1 if line is to run, 0 if line is to remain off
TBuffer- The number of pallets which can be bufered on the transfer line for that section (0 to 5)
Present - If lien is present but not to feed pallet = 1. if line is not at all present = 0.
LBuffer- Type of buffering for the mainline to run
0= no buffering on mainline; 100 = mainline runs constantly without buffering 

Line Configuration:
Line Present Feed TBuffer	LBuffer
Line1   1     1     4       100	
Line2   1     1     4       100	
Line3   1     1     4       100
Line4   1     1     1       0
Line5   1     1     1       0


% Variables to set the presence or absense of the splitter and upstream feed units, 1 = present,0=not present
% for the splitter the modes of operation are Code(seperates out pallets with a specified code), Colour ( seperates pallets with a specified color)
and Quality ( specifya table of colours and codes, any pallets not matching this table are removed from the line). 


Splitter1 	1	Colour
Splitter2 	0 	Code
Upstream	0	Main



% Feed Schedule 

Feed rates:
% for each active line a feed rate must be set according to the following parameters
P(n)=Periodic(time n)
N(m,sd)=Normal Distribution(mean, standard deviation)
R(L,M)=Rectangular Distribution(Lowest Value, Max Value)
T(L,P,M)=Triangular Distribution(Lowest Value, Value at Peak, Max Value)
