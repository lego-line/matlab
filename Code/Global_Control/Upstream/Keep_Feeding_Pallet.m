% Keep_Feeding_Pallet.m  This file contains the code to: 
	% Move a newly fed pallet forward from 'a' to 'b'.
	% Proceed through the five stages of the feeding sequence. 
	% NB: Feeding a pallet leads to a = 1 in phase 4.  This is used to
	% trigger the conveyor to move the pallet forward from 'a' to 'b' and update the status.
    % without causing the line to fail when new palelts are added as the
    % upstream unit should not jam.
